         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>CHarles</hi> the Second, by the Grace of God King of <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To all Our loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Our Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of what degree or quality ſoever, Greeting: It having pleaſed Almighty God out of his great mercy and compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Vs, and all Our Subjects, to reſtore Vs in ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful a manner to each other, and with ſo wonderful cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of affection and confidence in each other, as muſt for ever fill Our Hearts (if We are in any degree ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch Bleſſings) with an humble and grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the Obligation We owe to His Divine Providence, That he would vouchſafe to work that miracle for Vs himſelf, which no endeavours of Our own could bring to paſs: We think it agreable to the juſt ſenſe We have, and ought to have of the good affection of all Our good Subjects, who have contributed ſo much in bringing this unſpeakable Bleſſing upon Vs &amp; themſelves, that We acknowledge that our good Subjects in Our Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> have born a very good part in procuring this happineſs, that they were early in their dutiful Addreſſes to Vs, and made the ſame profeſſions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38452:7"/>
of a reſolution to return to their Duty and Obedience to Vs, during the time of Our being beyond the Seas, which they have ſince ſo eminently made good, and put in practiſe: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was not eaſy for us to make any publick Declaration with reference to that Our Kingdome, there being many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, in the providing for, and complying with the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Intereſts and Pretences there, which We were bound in Honour and Iuſtice in ſome degree to take care of, and which were different from the difficulties We were to contend with in this Kingdome: We well knew the Acts of Parliament which had formerly paſt for the ſecurity of the Adventurers in that Kingdom, &amp; had heard of the proceedings which had been thereupon, by which very many Officers, Souldiers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as well of this, as that Our Kingdome, were in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a great part of the Lands of that Our Kingdom, and of whoſe Intereſts we reſolve to be very careful.</p>
            <p>We well remember the Ceſſation, and the Peace which Our Royal Father of bleſſed Memory had been forced during the late troubles to make with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Subjects of that Our Kingdome, and by which he was compelled to give them a full pardon for what they had before done amiſs upon their return to their Duty, and their promiſe of giving his Majeſty a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous aſſiſtance, and that from that time divers perſons of Honour and Quality had not (that We know or have heard of) ſwerved from their Allegiance towards him or Vs. We could not forget the Peace that Our ſelf was afterwards ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to make with Our ſaid Subjects, in the time when they who wickedly Vſurped the Authority in this Kingdome, had erected that Odious Court for the taking away of the Life of Our dear Father; And then no body can wonder that we were deſirous, though upon difficult conditions, to get ſuch an Vnited power of Our own Subjects, as might have been able, with Gods bleſſing, to have prevented that infamous and horrible Parricide.</p>
            <p>And therefore We could not but hold Our ſelf obliged to perform what we owe by that Peace, to thoſe who had honeſtly and faithfuly performed what they had promiſed to Vs, though We and they were miſerably diſappointed of the effect of thoſe promiſes, by an unhappy part of them which fooliſhly forfeited all the Grace which they might have expected from Vs.</p>
            <p>And in the laſt place, We did and muſt alwayes remember the great affection a conſiderable part of that Nation expreſt to Vs, during the time of Our being beyond the Seas, when with all cheerfulnes and obedience they received &amp; ſubmitted to Our Orders, and betook themſelves to that ſervice which We dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as moſt convenient and behoofeful at that time to Vs,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38452:7"/>
though attended with inconveniencie enough to themſelves: Which demeanour of theirs, cannot but be thought very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Our Protection, Iuſtice and Favour: And yet all theſe important conſiderations and obligations appeared ſo many contradictions to the preſent Intereſt of Our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in that Our Kingdome, who had at this time likewiſe merited very much from Vs, and for whoſe ſecurity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage We held Our ſelf obliged, to provide as well as for their Indempnity, and ſo the good Settlement of that Our Kingdome appeared much the more difficult unto Vs, and even leſſened and abated much of that joy of heart We found Our ſelf poſſeſſed with, for the great bleſſings We enjoy in the peace and quiet of this our Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But We raiſed Our ſpirits again with the comfortable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that God who had wrought ſo much for Vs in <hi>England</hi> would graciouſly bring his Work to the ſame perfection in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp; not ſuffer Our good Subjects to weep in the one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whileſt they rejoyced in the other: And Our ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was much increaſed, when upon conference with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of Our good Subjects (of that Nation) of Quality and Intereſt, who were concerned both as Souldiers and Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers,</p>
            <p>We found that they had a due ſenſe of the Obligations which ſay upon Our Honour and Iuſtice; and were very willing, that We ſhould comply with both, and that the Foundations of the Peace and Security of that Kingdom ſhould be raiſed upon Our diſcharge of thoſe Obligations; and after they had ſpent much time amongſt others, who were as much, or more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned than themſelves, they freely conſented to ſuch conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as to Our underſtanding may reaſonably take with all juſt Intereſts: And We cannot doubt but that all who have merited from Vs, will confeſs that We have been ſo far from being failing to them, that We have as well provided for them, as after ſo great Troubles and Confuſions, and after ſuch bleſſed Circumſtances of Our Reſtaurat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on, they could reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expect, and that they will patiently wait for further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Our Favour and Kindneſs towards them, from the Peace, Vnity, and Settlement of that Kingdome, and from their contributing to it by a full ſubmiſſion to theſe Our determinations herein, and hereafter more particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and declared.</p>
            <p>And therefore in the firſt place, in Order to a Settlement of that Intereſt claimed by the Adventurers, although the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Eſtates and Poſſeſſions they enjoy, if they were examined by the ſtrict Letter of the Law, would prove very defective and invalid, as being no wayes purſuant to thoſe Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38452:8"/>
upon which they pretend to be founded, but rather ſeem to be a ſtructure upon their ſubſequent aſſent, both to different Mediums and Ends, than the obſervance of thoſe: Yet We being alwayes more ready to conſult (where the prejudice can only reflect upon Our ſelf) with Our natural inclinations to mercy (We praiſe God We can ſay ſo) than with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Reaſon of Law: We do hereby declare, That all the Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, of which all or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Adventurers were poſſeſſed the Seventh day of <hi>May,</hi> One thouſand Six hundred Fifty nine, having been allotted or ſet out to them, or enjoyed by them as Adventurers in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of, and for their Adventures, ſhall be confirmed and made good to them, their Heirs, and Aſſigns for ever, with allowance or correction of the Admeaſurement, according to the Tenor &amp; Directions of the reſpective Acts of Parliament of <hi>XVII</hi> and <hi>XVIII Caroli,</hi> as to <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Plantation</hi> Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; except as is hereafter excepted: and that the defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Adventurer, either in part or in whole, ſhall be ſatisfied out of the Moiety of the Counties of <hi>Limrick, Tipperary,</hi> and <hi>Waterford,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Munſter,</hi> the <hi>Kings County,</hi> the <hi>Queens County,</hi> and the Counties of <hi>Eaſt-Meath</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Meath,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> and the Counties of <hi>Down, Antrim,</hi> and <hi>Armagh,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> not yet ſet out to the ſaid Adventurers; as alſo the Forfeited Lands in the County of <hi>Lowth,</hi> (except the Barony of <hi>Atherdee</hi> in the ſaid County) and ſaid Province of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> ſuch Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers claiming and making their difficiencies appear before the Firſt day of <hi>May</hi> next: and in caſe the ſaid Lands ſo for ſupply of deficiencies ſet forth, ſhall not be ſufficient, We will appoint ſome other convenient Forfeited Lands for their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, ſo that all their deficiencies ſhall ſpeedily be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Officers and Souldiers now of Our Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that have been formerly of the Army in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> have had alſo Lands ſet out to them reſpectively, in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfrction of their arrears of Pay for their Service in that Our Kingdome, and are accordingly poſſeſt of the ſame by former pretended Orders and Powers then in being: And although the incompetency of ſuch Powers may juſtly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch Poſſeſſions and Eſtates liable to queſtion, to Our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great advantage, if We ſhould meaſure ſuch advantage, rather by the increaſe of Our Revenue, then by the free and unbounded influence of Our Mercy and Favour: Yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Our Letter to General <hi>Monk</hi> from <hi>Breda,</hi> in the Twelfth Year of Our Reign, and of Our ſeveral Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one and Proclamations concerning the Army, and of the full

(the ſole ſubſiſtance of them and their Families) expoſed to certainty of loſs (though greater inconveniencies We pretermit) may eaſily be judged: To this We might adde, That ſince the perſons of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> for whom we do hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſatisfaction, are ſuch who have been abroad with Vs, who probably being not furniſhed with Stock and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, may with leſs inconveniencies wait for a Reprizal, than to diſpoſſeſs others, eſpecially ſince we are fully aſſured that a very ſhort time may and will Aſſign them their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Reprizals, there being ſo good and large a proportion of undiſpoſed Forfeited lands in Our Power reſerved for this purpoſe, and We doubt not but the perſons moſt concerned in this ſuppoſed prejudice, throughly weighing theſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, and that they will be but of a ſhort duration, and how great and reaſonable a diſſatisfaction a contrary acting in Vs will produce, will acquieſce therein, &amp; by ſuch a forbearance lay the Foundation of a good Vnderſtanding between themſelves &amp; thoſe other their fellow-ſubjects who are to be ſettled with them in that Our Kingdome.

And that ſuch tranſplanted perſons as ſhall be diſpoſſeſt of their Decreed Eſtates in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught</hi> or <hi>Clare,</hi> by virtue of this Our Declaration, ſhall be Reprized out of other Forfeited lands of equal value, worth, and purchaſe in the ſaid Province of <hi>Connaught,</hi> or County of <hi>Clare,</hi> or elſewhere, before they be diſpoſſeſt of their ſaid E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.

            <p>And becauſe We are too credibly aſſured, That in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Iudgements given for Forfeited lands in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Connaught</hi> and County of <hi>Clare,</hi> much injuſtice and fraud hath been uſed, We ſhall recommend the whole review of that buſineſs to Our Chief Governour or Governours for the time being, and Our Privy Council and Commiſſioners or ſome of them, to the end, that whatever irregularity ſhall be found in thoſe proceedings may by their Care and Wiſdome be rectified, and the Iuſt part thereof confirmed. As alſo, that a ſuitable Act for <hi>Ireland</hi> for confirming Iudicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings there in the four Courts, may be there paſt; And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Act for ratifying all Decrees and Iudgements in the Court of Claims, and Exchequer of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the Claims of Our Proteſtant Subjects of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that ſo all Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects being legally ſetled and confirmed in their lives, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Eſtates, they may without fear for the Future be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to mend the Ruines and Deſolations of ſo long and bloody War, and live in comfort and unity. And We more than hope that by Our thus proceeding, the World will believe nothing of Our own Advantage can come in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with the Peace and Good of Our Subjects; for We reſerve little to Our Self but the ſatisfaction of contenting all Intereſts, at the price of freely parting with almoſt all the great Forfeitures veſted in Vs by Law in that Our Kingdom: And if by this Indulgence We ſhall attain that deſired end, it will be much more conſiderable unto Vs, than the rate at which We purchaſe it.</p>
            <p>And We further Declare, That whereas ſeveral of the Adventurers and Souldiers having made a thankful eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our grace and favour expreſſed by this our Declaration, in ſettling them in a peaceable poſſeſſion and right of what they enjoy, by Our waving thoſe many advantages devolved upon us by law, have voluntarily expreſt their own willingneſs and confidence of the forwardneſs of all the reſt of their Brethren,

            <p>And We do laſtly declare, That Proteſtant Plantations ſhall be ſettled, Corporations created, Churches erected, Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for Preaching Miniſters provided, within the limits and precincts of the land ſo to be ſettled on the Adventurers and Souldiers, in ſuch manner as by the Commiſſioners to be nominated and directed by Vs, ſhall be ſet down.</p>
            <p>Provided always, That this Our Declaration ſhall not extend to any perſon or perſons who have had any hand in the plotting and contriving the Surpriſal of Our Caſtle of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> in the year One thouſand ſix hundred forty one; nor to any perſon or perſons that ſate as Iudges in the pretended High Court of Iuſtice upon the life of Our Royal Father of bleſſed memory, or who ſentenced Him, or ſigned or ſealed the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for Execution, or who were of the Guard of Halbertiers, aſſiſting to put the Bloody Sentence of Death in Execution upon the 30. of <hi>January,</hi> One thouſand ſix hundred forty &amp; eight.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS by Our ſaid Declaration of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>November,</hi> One thouſand ſix hundred and ſixty, We have made proviſion for the Settlement of Our Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Satisfaction of the ſeveral Intereſts of Adventurers, Souldiers and others Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects there, which we are minded to put in effectual Execution: We have therefore hereby nominated you, or any five or more of you, whereof two of the perſons following to be alwayes preſent, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Our Truſty and Right well beloved Couſin and Counſellour <hi>Arthur</hi> Lord Viſcount <hi>Valentia,</hi> Our Vice-Treaſurer and General Receiver of Our ſaid Realm, Our Truſty and well beloved Counſellour Sir <hi>James Barry, James Donelan</hi>

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Sir <hi>James Ware,</hi> Our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney, and Solicitor General, Our Commiſſioners for the putting in Execution the matters and things therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the Tenor of theſe following Inſtructions.</p>
            <p>You are to caſt up the whole Debt and Demand of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers, as well thoſe that are ſatisfied, as thoſe that are in part or in whole deficient, as alſo all the forfeited Lands aſſigned to, or for the ſaid Adventurers, according to the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey commonly called Doctor <hi>Petty</hi>'s Down Admeaſurement: And the ſaid Demands and Lands you are to compare toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and what the ſaid Lands fall ſhort of ſatisfying the ſaid Adventurers, according to the Rates, Meaſures and Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of which all or any of the Adventurers were poſſeſſed the Seventh of <hi>May</hi> One thouſand ſix hundred fifty nine, ſo much of the forfeited Lands in the County of <hi>Lowth</hi> in the Province of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> (except the Barony of <hi>Atherdee</hi>) you are to ſet apart for ſatisfaction of the ſaid Adventurers; And if the ſaid forfeited Lands ſhall fall ſhort of ſatisfying the ſaid Adventurers, you are then to add the forfeited Lands undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Our ſaid Declaration, in the County of <hi>Catherlogh;</hi> And if thoſe ſhall fall ſhort; then the Lands remaining undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of in the County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> to ſupply all the ſaid Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers deficiencies; And if thoſe Lands fall ſhort, then you are apart other forfeited Lands in ſome convenient place for the end aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>And in order to the more particular apportioning or dividing the ſaid Lands amongſt the ſaid Adventurers, and ſatisfying their deficiencies, &amp; aſcertaining their reſpective proportions, You are to cauſe publick Proclamation to be made within the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38452:18"/>
reſpective Counties, Cities, Baronies, and places in <hi>Ireland,</hi> thereby directing each Adventurer, his Aſſignee or Aſſignees, or his or their Agent or Agents, ſufficiently authorized, that hath received any ſatisfaction in Land for his Adventure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in forty dayes after ſuch Proclamation, to deliver unto you in writing under his Hand and Seal a particular of the Houſes, Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments poſſeſſed by him, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the content or number of Acres both profitable and unprofitable, in each Town-Land, Village, Balybo, or Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Land, as the ſame were admeaſured to him, or for his uſe, and in the Right of whom he claimeth ſuch Adventure. And if ſuch Adventure be for Houſes in any city, ſuch Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer is to deliver in, not onely the particular Houſes, Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Hereditaments by him poſſeſſed, but alſo the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of them reſpectively, as ſet out to him, or any other for his uſe.</p>
            <p>And if any Adventurer, or the Aſſignee or Aſſignees of ſuch Adventurers as aforeſaid, ſhall neglect to return a Certificate as above-ſaid, or ſhall wittingly make and deliver a falſe Certificate of the ſums he was to be ſatisfied, according to the ſeveral Acts paſt in the Parliament begun at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the third day of <hi>November,</hi> in the year of Our Lord One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred and Forty, and in the ſixteenth Year of the Reign of Our Royal Father, entituled, <hi>An Act for the ſpeedy and effectual reducing of the Rebels in his Majeſties Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to their due obedience to his Majeſty and the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> An Act for adding unto, and explaining of certain clauſes in another Act made this Parliament, intituled, An Act for the ſpeedy and effectual reducing of the Rebels in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to their due obedience to his Majeſty and the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> An Act for the further advancement of an effectual and ſpeedy reduction of the Rebels in <hi>Ireland</hi> to the obedience of his Majeſty and the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> An Act for a ſpeedy Contribution and Loan towards the relief of his Majeſties diſtreſſed Subjects of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland;</hi> An Act to enable Corporations and Bodies Politick to participate of the benefit of an Act lately paſſed, intituled, An Act for the ſpeedy and effectual reducing of the Rebels in his Majeſties Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to their due obedience to his Majeſty and the Crown of <hi>England:</hi>
               </hi> Or ſhall neglect to return a Certificate as aforeſaid, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly make and deliver a falſe Certificate of the Town-Lands, Villages, Balyboes, Quarters, or other Denominations of Land aſſigned or given out for ſatisfaction of the ſaid Debt or Demand, or of the content or number of Acres, according as the ſame was ſet out to him or them, ſuch Adventurer, or his Aſſignee ſhall forfeit for three years the Rents and Profits
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38452:18"/>
that ſuch Houſes, Lands, Tenements, Hereditaments ſhall yeild, that he ſhall ſo omit to certifie, or that he ſhall not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certifie; ſuch Forfeiture to be one Moyety to Vs, and the other to be for and towards the defraying the charges in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting this Our Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>Provided, a Diſcovery be made thereof before the three and twentieth of <hi>October</hi> One Thouſand Six Hundred Sixty Three.</p>
            <p>That ſuch of the ſaid Adventurers and Souldiers as have taken Surveys of their Lands, do at or before the nine and twentieth day of <hi>September</hi> One thouſand ſix hundred ſixty two, bring in to you the ſaid Surveys or Duplicates thereof, together with the Field-Books, (if in their poſſeſſions) the which you are carefully and exactly to compare with the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys taken by Order of the late pretended Powers; And if you ſhall find any conſiderable difference between the ſaid Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys, you are to aſcertain ſuch Adventurers and Souldiers poſſeſſions by ſuch of the Surveys as ſhall appear moſt for Our advantage, and furtherance of this Service. Yet ſo, that if ſuch Adventurer or Souldier ſhall think himſelf aggrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thereat, You ſhall appoint one or more ſworn Surveyors to re-ſurvey the ſaid Lands in queſtion, ſuch Surveyor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning his Field-Book to ſome other ſworn Surveyor, to examine, caſt up, and make up the ſame, ſuch Adventurer or Souldier paying the ſaid Surveyor for their ſaid work, and in the mean ſuch Adventurer and Souldier to be continued in poſſeſſion according to the Survey which ſhall appear as aforeſaid, moſt for Our Advantage: and if any one ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe complain, and obtain a re-ſurvey, he ſhall, as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty for ſo doing, forfeit ſo much land as he claims to want, and ſhall not be found wanting. And if any ſuggeſtion or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation ſhall be made to the Lord Lieutenant, or other Chief Governour or Governours of <hi>Ireland</hi> for the time being, That profitable lands are held and poſſeſſed as unprofitable, the ſame ſhall be inquired of by a Iury, and ſuch lands as were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed and ſet out to Adventurers and Souldiers, or their Aſſigns, as unprofitable, and ſhall by ſuch inquiry be found profitable, ſhall be re-aſſumed to ſupply Deficiencies, or make Repriſals. Out of which ſaid Certificates and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys, and by ſuch other lawful ways and means as you ſhall think fit, you are to make up Books of what is due to each Adventurer, and to aſcertain the poſſeſſion of ſuch to whom lands are aſſigned, therein expreſſing who was the former Proprietor who forfeited the ſame the three and twentieth of <hi>October</hi> One thouſand ſix hundred forty one, or ſince; the Town-land, Village, Balyboe, Quarter, or other Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38452:19"/>
of Land, the content, or number of Acres, the Pariſh, Barony, County and Province, in which ſuch Lands do lye reſpectively; and where you ſhall find any Adventurer or his Aſſign to have more Lands than will ſatisfie his Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that ſuch Adventurer be in any other place deficient, or ſhall buy the Right of any deficient Adventurer, that ſuch Over-plus Lands ſhall be aſſigned unto him towards ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſuch deficiencies: and having brought things to this certainty, you are to ſet out Lands to the deficient Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in ſuch way as ſhall be moſt indifferent and impartial, and purſuant to the Acts of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Whereas We have been graciouſly pleaſed to appoint the Forfeited Lands in the County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> for ſatisfaction of Incumbrances on the Eſtates of Adventurers and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, according to Our ſaid Declaration; in the ſatisfying thereof, you are to obſerve theſe following Directions, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To examine in the Books and Records of the late Court of Claims, or Exchequer, or other Courts, what Decrees or Iudgements were paſſed and allowed to be ſatisfied out of the Eſtates of the ſaid Adventurers and Souldiers, the Adventurer and Souldier claiming ſatisfaction for ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance, ſhall make it appear that the ſaid Decreed Lands are ſet out unto him as part of his lot, and he thereby Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled to the Reprize for the ſaid Incumbrance. If ſuch Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance be by Mortgage, Statute Staple, Iudgement, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance, or of any ſum of Money on the payment whereof the Land ſo Incumbred is to be free and diſcharged, you are then to ſet out Lands in the ſaid County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the ſaid Incumbrance after the rate of Ten years purchaſe to be aſcertained by inquiry, in way and manner, as is hereafter directed for the Reprize of ſuch Adventurers and Souldiers as ſhall be removed from off their preſent Eſtates, or according to ſuch other particular Directions, as you ſhall receive herein from Vs, or from Our Chief Governour or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Council of that Our Kingdome for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, agreable to Our ſaid Declaration: If ſuch Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance be a Rent-charge or Yearly Rent, iſſuing or payable out of the Eſtates of the ſaid Adventurers or Souldiers for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or for years, or for life, You are then to put a Rate or Value on ſuch Rent-charge, not exceeding Ten years Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, for an Eſtate for ever, or Six years Purchaſe if for life, or for any term under Ten years, or Seven years Purchaſe if for Two lives, or any term above Ten years and under Twenty one years, or Eight years purchaſe for any term a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Twenty one years, and under Thirty one years, and Nine years Purchaſe for all above Thirty one years, which

If ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance be by Leaſe or Leaſes for term of years, or for life or lives, you ſhall, as is before directed, inquire after the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage ſuch Adventurer or Souldier ſuſtains by virtue of ſuch Leaſe; and if the ſaid term ſhall not exceed ſeven years, or the damage be not one third part of the full value of the ſaid Lands ſet out to him, you ſhall not aſſign any recompence or Reprize; but if ſuch damage be for above Seven years, or above one third part of the profits of ſuch Eſtate, ſatisfaction is to be given in way and manner as in the preceding In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions is directed: The which Lands being thus ſet out, allotted and diſtributed to the ſaid Adventurers, and Reprized to the ſaid Adventurers and Souldiers, you are to give unto them reſpectively a Certificate of what Lands are ſo ſet out unto them, with the number of acres, Denominations of the ſaid Lands, the Pariſh, Barony and County ſuch Lands are in, and who Forfeited the ſame; which Certificate the ſaid Adventurers &amp; Souldiers are forthwith to Record in Our Court of Exchequer, upon which Our ſaid Court is to give Order to Our reſpective Sheriffs to put the ſaid Adventurers and Souldiers, their Aſſigns or Agents, into the poſſeſſion of ſuch Lands ſo allotted, divided, and ſet out, or reprized, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Whereas by Our ſaid Declaration the Eſtates of every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſons that ſate as Iudges in the pretended High Court of Iuſtice, upon the Life of Our Royal Father of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Memory, or who Sentenced him, or who Signed or Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Warrant for Execution, or who were of the Guard of Halberteers, aſſiſting to put the Bloody Sentence of Death in execution upon the Thirtieth of <hi>January,</hi> One thouſand Six hundred Forty eight, are not confirmed: You are therefore to inquire what Eſtates any of the ſaid perſons had, and to return Certificates thereof into Our Court of Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, which Court is hereby required to ſieze the ſame to Our uſe, and for the increaſe of Our Revenue, except ſo much of the ſame lands, Tenements and Hereditaments lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>John Cook,</hi> as by Our Letters of the Twenty fourth of <hi>November</hi> laſt was granted by Vs to Sir <hi>George Lane</hi> Knight, for his faithful Service, which it is Our will and pleaſure ſhall be confirmed to him, his Heirs and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns accordingly; and that all proceedings neceſſary for the finding Our Title thereunto, and to the lands, Tenements and Hereditaments of <hi>Philip Hoare</hi> of <hi>Kilſalchan</hi> in the ſame letter to the ſaid Sir <hi>George Lane</hi> granted, be ſpeedily made by Our Officers and Miniſters intruſted in that behalf, and

            <p>And whereas many being conſcious of their own guilt or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil intentions, with reſpect to the moſt heinous Rebellion begun the Three and Twentieth of <hi>October,</hi> One thouſand Six hundred Forty and One, have made private Settlements of their Eſtates, and many of Our Proteſtant Subjects ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving formerly Mortgaged their Houſes, Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments, unto ſuch as have Forfeited the ſame in theſe evil and unſetled Times, have notwithſtanding entred upon and keep poſſeſſion of Our Right, You are therefore in the beſt way and manner you can to make a Diſcovery of all ſuch or any other concealments to Our prejudice; In Order whereunto, Our Officers in Our Four Courts of <hi>Dublin,</hi> or in the Office for Probat of Wills, are required to be aiding and aſſiſting to you herein, and from time to time to ſearch after ſuch matters or things as you ſhall judge for Our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to inquire after and to attend you with ſuch Records as you ſhall judge needful.</p>
            <p>Whereas by Our ſaid Declaration ſeveral innocent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and Papiſts are to be reſtored to their Eſtates, and a Reprize of equal value, worth and purchaſe is to be aſſigned to ſuch Adventurers and Souldiers, and other perſons as do poſſeſſe the ſame; in the doing thereof, you are to obſerve theſe following directions, <hi>viz.</hi>
